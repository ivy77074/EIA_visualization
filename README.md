# Energy Information Administration (EIA) Production Visualization
An EIA production visualization app by coding with Streamlit in Python. It shows basin map images and interactive graphs about the information on "crude oil and natural gas production from shale and tight formations" and parts of "drilling productivity metrics". 

# Each Folder
This section will introduce each folder's functions.

## update data
This folder contains the font and original images used to update the pictures on the website. Running codes can gather new information in EIA, generate new images, and know the next release date.

## CO_NG_images
Store pictures of crude oil and natural gas production from shale and tight formations locally.

## dpr images
Store images of drilling productivity metrics locally.

## website
website.py file is the main file that structures the app. The main.py file is for my convenience to run and test on my local computer.

# Notice
Since images in the app were generated and stored locally, the information may not match new data if we do not update it.
